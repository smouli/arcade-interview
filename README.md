# Arcade Data Parser

A Python solution for parsing Arcade JSON data to extract user interactions and generate human-friendly summaries.

## Features

‚úÖ **Identify User Interactions**: Extracts and lists all user actions in human-readable format  
‚úÖ **AI-Powered Summaries**: Uses OpenAI GPT-4 to generate intelligent, context-aware summaries  
‚úÖ **Social Media Image Generation**: Creates promotional images using DALL-E 3 based on analyzed data  
‚úÖ **JSON File Processing**: Direct parsing from JSON files  
‚úÖ **Detailed Analysis**: Provides event counts, flow names, and contextual information  
‚úÖ **Fallback Support**: Gracefully handles API failures with local summary generation  
‚úÖ **Customizable Prompts**: Easy-to-modify system prompts for both summaries and image generation  

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

```bash
python analyze_arcade.py <json_file> [--generate-image]
```

### Examples

```bash
# Basic analysis
python analyze_arcade.py example_data.json

# Analysis with social media image generation
python analyze_arcade.py example_data.json --generate-image
```

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from arcade_parser import parse_arcade_data
import json

# Load your JSON data
with open('your_data.json', 'r') as f:
    json_data = f.read()

# Parse the data
result = parse_arcade_data(json_data)

# Access results
interactions = result['user_interactions']
summary = result['summary']

# Generate social media image
result_with_image = parse_arcade_data(json_data, generate_image=True)
image_path = result_with_image.get('social_media_image')
```

## Output Format

The parser generates two main outputs:

### 1. User Interactions List
- Human-readable action descriptions
- Examples: "Clicked on button: 'Add to cart'", "Searched for 'scooter'"

### 2. AI-Generated Human-Friendly Summary
- Intelligent analysis of user behavior using OpenAI GPT-4
- Context-aware summaries that understand user intent
- Natural language descriptions of user goals and actions
- Automatic fallback to rule-based summaries if AI is unavailable

### 3. Social Media Promotional Images
- AI-generated promotional images using DALL-E 3
- Product-focused designs with discount/promotional elements
- Optimized for social media engagement
- Automatically incorporates product details and branding

## Configuration

### Summary Parsing Prompt

The system uses OpenAI's GPT model to generate human-friendly summaries. You can customize the prompt used for summary generation by modifying the default prompt below:

**Default System Prompt:**
```
You are an expert at analyzing user behavior data from web interactions. Your task is to create a clear, concise, and human-friendly summary of what a user was trying to accomplish during their session.

Given the following information about a user's session:
- Flow name: {flow_name}
- Website: {website}
- Search terms: {search_terms}
- User interactions: {interactions}

Please generate a summary that:
1. Explains what the user was trying to accomplish
2. Highlights the key actions they took
3. Infers their likely goals or intentions
4. Uses natural, conversational language
5. Keeps the summary to 2-3 sentences maximum

Focus on the user's journey and what they were trying to achieve, not just listing actions.
```

To modify this prompt, edit the `SUMMARY_PROMPT` section in the `arcade_parser.py` file.

### Image Generation System Prompt

The system can generate engaging social media images based on the analyzed user flow data. The image generation uses OpenAI's DALL-E model with prompts loaded from the external `prompts.txt` file:

**Image Generation Approach:**

To ensure 100% reliable and readable text, the system uses a **hybrid two-step approach**:

1. **Clean Product Image**: DALL-E generates a professional product image with NO TEXT
2. **Perfect Text Overlays**: PIL (Python Imaging Library) adds crisp, readable text overlays
3. **Guaranteed Readability**: Text is rendered using system fonts, ensuring perfect clarity

**Generated Text Elements:**
```
Discount Badge: "15% OFF", "20% OFF", or "25% OFF"
Product Name: Shortened product name (e.g., "Razor Scooter")
Urgency Text: "Today Only", "Limited Time", or "Flash Sale"
Call-to-Action: "Shop Now", "Get Yours", or "Buy Today"
Taglines: Product-specific (e.g., "Blue or Pink", "Ride in Style")
Additional: "Free Shipping", "Best Price", "Top Rated"
Branding: Website name in caps (e.g., "TARGET")
```

**Image Generation System Prompt** (from `prompts.txt`):
```
